            Hi as you already know my name is Jaylen Mitchell I am a 14 year-old boy at the time making this web page, and is curious to learn more. My first two languages are <b><i>HTML & CSS</i></b>.
            I got to a program called the hidden genius which you can find here:
        </p>
        <a href = "http://www.hiddengeniusproject.org" class = "url" target="_blank"><b>Click Me-Hidden Genius Project Link</b></a>
        <p>
            Some of the things you learn there are <i>computer science, </i>entrepreneurship skills, And leadership skills that is the reason I probably like it so much.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite things to do are play videogames and watch youtube videos. Thats pretty much the norm for the people I hang around. The only reason I got interested in coding is to explore how I could make somethign I use so much.
            My daily routine for activities during the summer would look like this.
        </p>
        <P> What I really want to learn by the end of finishing codeHs is how to make a website like this look visually pleasing. Not just a bad looking html page with barely any CSS.</P>
